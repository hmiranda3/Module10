//PART 1
//
//Make a constant for currentYear that is an integer equal to the current year (i.e. 2016).
//Create a Person struct with properties for first name as a String, last name as a String, and year of birth as an Int.
//Make a new person from the Person struct
//Print out their birth year
//Print out their first and last name
//PART 2
//
//Add a computed property of age: Int to the Person struct
//Make a getter on the age that calculates the person's age based on the current year and the person's year of birth. (Hint: Look up getters in the Swift programming guide or in documentation)
//Make a setter on the age that updates the year of birth based on the age and current year. (Hint: look up setters)
//Print out their age
//Update their age and then print their new year of birth.
//â™¦ Black Diamond
//Change your currentYear constant so that instead of being a hard-coded, static year, it uses NSDateComponents to get the actual current year anytime it runs. Documentation should help you out.
